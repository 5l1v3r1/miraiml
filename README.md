> Mirai: _future_ in japanese.

MiraiML is an asynchronous engine for autonomous & continuous machine learning,
built for real-time usage.

MiraiML attempts to improve the chosen metric by searching good hyperparameters
and sets of features to feed statistical models.

A step-by-step tutorial can be found on the [example notebook](example.ipynb).

## Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## To do

- Provide a way for the user to design his own exploration strategies
- Provide rich visualizations for the optimization process
- Provide an `on_improvement` function for the engine
- Provide support for multi-class classification problems
- Generate documentation programmatically
- Improve repo structure
- Create unit tests
