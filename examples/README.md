# Examples

The dataset used in these examples will be imported from the csv file
`pulsar_stars.csv`, which can be downloaded from Kaggle ([Predicting a Pulsar
Star][pulsar]). It's a simple and clean dataset containing eight numeric features
and without null values. The target column is called `target_class` and contains
only 0's and 1's (it's a classification problem).
