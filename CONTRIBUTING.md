# Contributing

## Code of Conduct

1. Be polite, kind and respectful towards everyone
2. Welcome diversities and divergences of viewpoints
4. Do not go offtopic when commenting on issues

## Contributing with issues

You can contribute with [issues][issues] by:

* Proposing/requesting a `new feature`
* Reporting a `bug`
* Asking for `help`
* Pointing out typos or errors on the `documentation`
* Asking a `question`
* Presenting a better way to do something with a `better code`
* Giving tips for better project `management` practices

I've highlighted the labels that should be used in each case.

## Contributing with code

Code contributions can only be made if there is an **open issue** related to the
changes you want to make, where we have discussed and come to an agreement about
them.

Before commiting your changes, remember to increment the [version][version]
according to the [Semantic Versioning][semver] specification.

After opening a [pull request][pulls], insert the link to the issue on your pull
request comment and then post the link to your pull request on the respective
issue.
