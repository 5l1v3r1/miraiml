This section explains the mechanics of MiraiML.

A brief introduction
--------------------

    Mirai: `future` in japanese.

MiraiML is an asynchronous engine for autonomous & continuous machine learning,
built for real-time usage.

MiraiML attempts to improve the chosen metric by searching good hyperparameters
and sets of features to feed statistical models.

Even though the engine is autonomous, it offers (and requires) a certain degree
of configuration, in a way that the user has good control over what's happening
behind the scenes.
